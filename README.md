# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project is a part of my **machine learning learning journey**, where I implemented a **Customer Segmentation** model using **K-Means Clustering**. The objective is to identify different groups of customers based on their shopping behaviors, which can help businesses target their marketing strategies more effectively.


# Objective

To segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically **K-Means clustering**.


# Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing K-Means clustering

# DATA
The data has been taken from **KAGGLE** and the data was pre-processed to remove missing values and scaled where necessary.

# Workflow
1. Data Loading
  - Importing customer data using Pandas.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Understanding relationships and distributions using visual tools like histograms and scatter plots.

3. Preprocessing
    - Handling missing values
    - Normalizing/standardizing data for better clustering

4. Applying K-Means Clustering
    - Using the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
    - Fitting K-Means and assigning cluster labels

5. Visualization
 - Visualizing clusters using scatter plots
 - Coloring different groups to illustrate segmentation
